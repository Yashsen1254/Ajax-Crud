# CRUD Application with AJAX

This repository contains a simple CRUD application built using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for handling Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Overview

The CRUD application allows users to perform basic database operations on a resource, typically represented as items, entries, or records.

The application includes the following features:
- Create: Add new items to the database.
- Read: Retrieve and display existing items from the database.
- Update: Modify existing items in the database.
- Delete: Remove items from the database.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:
- HTML5: For structuring the web page.
- CSS3: For styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: For client-side scripting.
- AJAX: For asynchronous communication with the server.
- Backend Technology (e.g., Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.): For handling server-side logic and database operations.
- Database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.): For storing application data.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd crud-with-ajax
    ```

3. Set up the backend server and database according to the instructions provided in the `server/` directory.

4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the CRUD application.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Perform CRUD operations using the provided interface:
   - To create a new item, click on the "Add" or "Create" button.
   - To read existing items, view the list displayed on the page.
   - To update an item, select the item and click on the "Edit" button.
   - To delete an item, select the item and click on the "Delete" button.

3. The application communicates with the backend server using AJAX to perform operations without reloading the entire page.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the application are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
